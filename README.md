# Cell Image Analysis via Machine Learning
__Carlos Leon__


This project builds a machine learning model to recognize each cell on a sample photograph ("cell segmentation") to help hematologists' analysis.

## Introduction
New methodologies are required to accelerate processes  on critical areas including human health. Sample cells counting and analysis on the blood stream remains as the botleneck for patients diagnosis. The time-consuming task may be alleviated by the use of machine learning techniques to automatize the identification of cells.
